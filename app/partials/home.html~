				 <h1> Our Mission</h1>
		
			<p>
				Student ambassador is the face of an employer in an educational institution. They are just ordinary students who have decided to inform their campus on their favorite companies.	

			</p>

			<p>
				They are here so that students can comfortably chat with a familiar face on the companies of interest. 	

			</p>
			
			<p>
				Moreover, recommendations from student ambassadors are often accurate indication of talent. Often, these recommendations are derived from months and years of coworking experience rather than a few hours of observation.

			</p><br>

			<p>
				However, student ambassadors are currently very rare and there are no central listing for positions. 	

			</p><br>

			<p>
				Our goal is to change this unfortunate circumstance.
